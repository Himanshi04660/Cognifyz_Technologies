This project is part of the Data Analysis Internship, where we perform data manipulation on a restaurant dataset to uncover insights about cuisines, city-wise restaurant distributions, and online delivery trends.

The dataset includes information about:

Types of cuisines served:
1) Restaurant locations
2) Customer ratings
3) Price range distribution
4) Online delivery availability
By analyzing this data, we aim to extract key patterns and trends that could be useful for business decision-making in the food industry.
