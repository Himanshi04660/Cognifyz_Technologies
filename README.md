This project is part of the Data Analysis Internship, where we perform data manipulation on a restaurant dataset to uncover insights about cuisines, city-wise restaurant distributions, and online delivery trends.

The dataset includes information about:

Types of cuisines served:
1) Restaurant locations
2) Customer ratings
3) Online delivery availability
By analyzing this data, we aim to extract key patterns and trends that could be useful for business decision-making in the food industry.
