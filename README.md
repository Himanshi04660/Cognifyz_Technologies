This project is part of the Data Analysis Internship, where we perform data manipulation on a restaurant dataset to uncover insights about cuisines, city-wise restaurant distributions, and online delivery trends.

The dataset includes information about:

Types of cuisines served:
1) Restaurant locations
2) Customer ratings
3) Price range distribution
4) Online delivery availability
By analyzing this data, we aim to extract key patterns and trends that could be useful for business decision-making in the food industry.

Tasks Covered
The notebook Level1_tasks.ipynb contains multiple data analysis tasks categorized under Level 1. 


Level 1 Tasks are:

Task 1 - Top Cuisines Analysis:
Identified the most popular cuisines based on their frequency in the dataset.
Used data preprocessing to handle missing values in the "Cuisines" column.
Counted the occurrences of each cuisine and sorted them to determine the top cuisines.
This analysis helps in understanding food preferences and trends in different locations.

Task 2 - City Analysis:
Analyzed restaurant distribution across different cities.
Counted the number of restaurants in each city and visualized the data.
Provided insights into which cities have the most food establishments.
Helped in identifying high-density restaurant locations for potential business insights.

Task 3 - Price Range Distribution:
Examined the distribution of restaurants across different price ranges.
Categorized restaurants based on their price levels.
Used visualizations like bar plots or histograms to showcase price variations.
Provided insights into affordability and the pricing structure of restaurants.

Task 4 - Online Delivery Analysis:
Investigated the availability of online food delivery services.
Analyzed the proportion of restaurants offering online delivery.
Helped in understanding market trends and the adoption of online food services.
Could be useful for businesses looking to expand their delivery operations


Level 2 Tasks are:

Task 1 - Cuisine Combination Analysis:
Identify the most common cuisine combinations and determine if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.
Extracted cuisine combinations from the dataset.
Analyzed frequency and correlations between different cuisines.
Used visualizations such as heatmaps and bar charts to highlight trends.

Task 2 - Geographic Analysis:
Plot the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates to identify patterns or clusters.
Extracted geographic coordinates from the dataset.
Used Folium to generate an interactive map displaying restaurant locations.
Identified clusters and density of restaurants in specific regions.

Task 3 - Rating Distribution Analysis:
Understand the distribution of ratings given to restaurants.
Plotted a histogram to visualize the rating distribution.
Identified common rating trends (e.g., most frequent rating values).
Highlighted regions or categories with the highest and lowest ratings.

Task 4 - Price vs Rating Trends:
Analyze the relationship between the price range of restaurants and their ratings.
Used scatter plots and box plots to compare price range vs ratings.
Identified patterns indicating whether higher-priced restaurants receive better ratings.
Explored correlations between cost and customer satisfaction


Level 3 Tasks are:

Task 1: Restaurant Reviews
Prints most common positive and negative ratings.
Displays the average review length.
Shows a scatter plot of review length vs. aggregate rating.

Task 2: Votes Analysis
Prints top 5 and bottom 5 restaurants by votes.
Displays the correlation coefficient between votes and rating.
Generates a scatter plot of votes vs. ratings.

Task 3: Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking
Prints table booking and online delivery availability per price range.
